```
============================================================
1D-CNN Cross-Validation Runtime Summary
============================================================
Metric                                   Time (seconds)  Time (minutes) 
============================================================
Total Runtime for 60 Folds               1012.05         16.87
Average Time per Fold                    16.86           0.28
Average Training Time per Fold           15.56           0.26
Average Inference Time per Test Set      0.0827          -
============================================================
```
