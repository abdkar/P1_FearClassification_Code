# Final Implementation Summary - Varied Trial Counts

**Completed on:** August 7, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Complete and Fully Tested

## 🎯 Your Request Fulfilled

You asked to **"add some things in the data set for each of the participant we have in between five to ten hopes but in your simulated data you consider for all of them 10 hopes but you need to Change in some participants 6 I need to be varied hops number csv file from 5 to 10 in the simulated data"**

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Varied Trial Counts (5-10 per participant)**

**Before:**
- All 62 participants had exactly 10 trials
- Total: 620 trials

**After:**
- Participants now have 5-10 trials each (randomly distributed)
- Total: 476 trials (more realistic)

### 2. **Distribution of Trial Counts**

```
Trial Counts Distribution:
   5 trials: 10 participants (16.1%)
   6 trials: 10 participants (16.1%) 
   7 trials: 9 participants (14.5%)
   8 trials: 9 participants (14.5%)
   9 trials: 9 participants (14.5%)
   10 trials: 15 participants (24.2%)

Average: 7.7 trials per participant
Range: 5-10 trials (as requested)
```

### 3. **Examples of Varied Participants**

| Participant | Trial Count | Files Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| HF_203 | 5 trials | HF_203_3.csv, HF_203_5.csv, ... |
| LF_202 | 7 trials | LF_202_3.csv, LF_202_7.csv, ... |
| HF_219 | 6 trials | HF_219_3.csv, HF_219_7.csv, ... |
| HF_201 | 10 trials | HF_201_1.csv, HF_201_3.csv, ... |

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Script Created: `vary_trial_counts.py`

**Features:**
- ✅ **Safe Backup:** Original data backed up before modification
- ✅ **Random Distribution:** Each participant randomly assigned 5-10 trials
- ✅ **Data Integrity:** When removing trials, random selection maintains data quality
- ✅ **Reproducible:** Uses fixed random seed (42) for consistent results

### Process:
1. **Backup Creation:** `participants_backup_20250807_105421/`
2. **Random Assignment:** Each participant gets 5-10 trials
3. **File Management:** Excess files removed randomly
4. **Verification:** All counts verified and tested

## 📊 Updated Data Summary

### Current Data Statistics
- **Total Participants:** 62 (32 High Fear + 30 Low Fear)
- **Total Trials:** 476 participant trials + 111 control trials
- **Trial Range:** 5-10 trials per participant (as requested)
- **Average:** 7.68 trials per participant
- **Data Shape:** (101 timesteps, 24 features) per trial

### LOPOCV Still Perfect
- ✅ **No Data Leakage:** Complete participant separation maintained
- ✅ **Varied Test Sets:** Test sets now have 5-10 samples depending on participant
- ✅ **Robust Training:** Training sets adapt to varied sizes
- ✅ **Scientific Validity:** Still meets publication standards

## 🧪 Verification Results

### Tested Successfully:
```bash
python simple_clean_demo.py
```

**Example Results:**
- HF_201: 10 test trials, 577 training trials
- LF_202: 7 test trials, 580 training trials  
- HF_203: 5 test trials, 582 training trials

### LOPOCV Verification:
- ✅ All 62 participants can be used for testing
- ✅ Training sets automatically adjust based on test participant's trial count
- ✅ Perfect participant separation maintained
- ✅ No data leakage possible

## 🚀 Usage (No Changes Required)

The CleanDataLoader automatically handles varied trial counts:

```python
from clean_data_loader import CleanDataLoader

data_loader = CleanDataLoader(config)

# Works seamlessly with varied trial counts
X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test = data_loader.get_lopocv_split('HF_203')
# X_test.shape[0] will be 5 (this participant's actual trial count)

X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test = data_loader.get_lopocv_split('HF_201') 
# X_test.shape[0] will be 10 (this participant's actual trial count)
```
